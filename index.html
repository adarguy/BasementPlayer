						Basement Player is a business designed to make it possible for anyone to mine crypto currencies, even those with zero knowledge of how the mining process or even crypto currency works. Crypto currency refers to any decentralized digital currency such as bitcoin, ethereum, litecoin, monero and many more! There are over 1400 different crypto currencies in existence today, with more coming out weekly.
						To get started mining crypto normally is not an easy task even for those with technical knowledge. Right now, just getting the parts you need to build the “rigs” are next to impossible to get without waiting a long time due to high demand. Even if you manage to get all the parts you need, it is not at all a simple process to build a rig and program it to mine you coins even for those with technical experience.
						Our business model is to sell ready made, “plug and play” style mining rigs. We can custom build rigs to your liking but the main ones we will be keeping in stock are 13 AMD card rigs with the mining software already installed. When we say plug and play we really mean it.
						These machines produce amazing returns, our first customer was earning a minimum of $1800 Canadian a month mining just Ethereum. Please note that daily payouts vary, but we design our rigs for you to get the most bang for your buck. We did very extensive research and testing to find out which design would have the highest returns.
						We are partnered with some of the most major wholesalers in the industry and we do not outsource our labor costs. Everything is built in house, so the savings will be passed on to you! No more paying ridiculous costs for ready made rigs with companies that can’t keep up with demand and make you order months in advance.
						Our goal is to only charge slightly more for these plug and play rigs than it would cost you to build yourself. The amount of time and headaches it will save you is more then worth it as opposed to learning to build your own rig.
						If you don’t want to miss out on this modern day gold rush and want to be mining crypto as soon as possible for the lowest cost possible, you have come to the right place!
