                <p class="text-center">Basement Player is a business designed to make it possible for anyone to mine crypto currencies, even those with zero knowledge of how the mining process or even crypto currency works. To get started in mining crypto is not an easy task even for those with technical knowledge. Right now, just getting the parts you need to build the “rigs” is next to impossible without waiting a long time due to high demand. We sell ready made, “plug and play” style mining rigs. We offer standard pre-built 13 AMD card rigs with the mining software already installed or you can order a custom rig. <br>
                    
                    We have partnered with major wholesalers in the industry to provide high quality mining gear at competitive rates. Everything is built in house, so the savings will be passed on to you! No more paying ridiculous costs for ready made rigs with companies that can’t keep up with demand and make you order months in advance.<br></p>
