                            The Basement Player is an E-Commerce shop that supplies your most important computer parts. From Gaming equipment, high quality computer parts to plug and play crypto currency mining rigs, we are a one stop shop for all your gaming, computer and crypto needs! We are partnered with some of the most major wholesalers in the business. Because we have no retail store front, our overhead is low, and we can pass on extreme savings to you! If you are looking to buy a crypto mining rig, any other company selling “plug and play” style rigs like ours will not only be much more expensive, you will have to pay months in advance before your order is shipped! With us, you will get a much cheaper but even better performing setup as we do not outsource our labor costs. All rigs are built inhouse and, just like with any product, orders are shipped out the same or very next business day.

						    We are in the Toronto area in Ontario, Canada. We do not have a retail store open to the public but if you would like to see our products in person before purchasing, or, you would rather come pick up your order, customers are able to do so by appointment only. We do not publicly disclose our address for security reasons. The products we sell are in very high demand and many other suppliers have been the victims of theft and fraud.

                            We mostly ship to customers within North America, but, we are willing to ship worldwide so long as the customer is OK with the shipping cost.<br><br>
                            Most orders are shipped using Canada Post unless the customer requests a different carrier, or, the customer is in a country which Canada Post does not deliver to (they are very few countries they do not delivery to) any orders to countries that Canada Post cannot deliver will be shipped using FedEx. You will be sent a tracking number as soon as your order is shipped. All orders are shipped express, how long it takes will depend on how far away you are and of course certain things like winter storms can cause delays but, if you are in Ontario, you will receive within 2 business days, the rest of Canada within 4 business days, and USA customers will never have to wait more than 1 week. We do not give estimates for orders outside of North America but we have had many orders to Europe arrive in a week or less.

                            Yes. We build our crypto mining rigs so even those with zero knowledge of how the process works can plug the rig in and start mining! We specialize in 13 card rigs with the mining software already installed and of course we only use the top of the line graphic cards in our rigs (ones by Nivida and AMD) The more graphic cards a rig has, the more it can mine daily. Many people build 6 or 8 card rigs. Ours have 13 of the best graphic cards to get you the highest returns!

                            This is a somewhat tricky question as the mining difficulty is always changing and, there are nearly over 1000 crypto coins you are able to mine and each one will have different profitability daily based on the difficulty. We can tell you that we have had customers test our 13 card rigs and they chose to mine Ethereum. We heard back from one customer that he was earning at least $1800 Canadian dollars worth of Ethereum a month. Please realize that is not all profit, you will have to pay for the electricity your rig uses but considering how cheap our rigs are, that is a massive return. It will not take long at all for you to get back your initial investment and start earning great profits.
